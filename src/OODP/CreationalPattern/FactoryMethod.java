/*
How can an object be created so that subclasses can redefine which class to instantiate?
How can a class defer instantiation to subclasses?

A class implementing factory design pattern works as bridge between multiple classes.
Consider an example of using multiple database servers like SQL Server and Oracle.
If you are developing an application using SQL Server database as backend, but in future need to change backend database to oracle,
you will need to modify all your code, if you havenâ€™t written your code following factory design pattern.

Factory Method: creation through inheritance. Prototype: creation through delegation.
Prototype doesn't require subclassing, but it does require an "initialize" operation. Factory Method requires subclassing, but doesn't require Initialize.
