/*
The builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes whose constructors or static factories would have more than a handful of parameters.
prominent example is pizza class
This is called the Telescoping Constructor Pattern. The problem with this pattern is that once constructors are 4 or 5 parameters long it becomes
difficult to remember the required order of the parameters as well as what particular constructor you might want in a given situation.
One alternative you have to the Telescoping Constructor Pattern is the JavaBean Pattern where you call a constructor with the mandatory parameters
and then call any optional setters after:
The problem here is that because the object is created over several calls it may be in an inconsistent state partway through its construction.
This also requires a lot of extra effort to ensure thread safety.


designed to provide a flexible design solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming.
The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
The Builder design pattern solves problems like:
How can a class (the same construction process) create different representations of a complex object?
How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?


-Advantages
    Allows you to vary a productâ€™s internal representation.
    Encapsulates code for construction and representation.
    Provides control over steps of construction process.
-Disadvantages
    Requires creating a separate ConcreteBuilder for each different type of product.
    Requires the builder classes to be mutable.
    Data members of class aren't guaranteed to be initialized.
    Dependency injection may be less supported.
